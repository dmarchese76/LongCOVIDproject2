These types of programs help patients manage symptoms like fatigue, breathing difficulties, and mobility issues, often through physical therapy.</p><p>But rehabilitation alone can’t replace the multidisciplinary care many patients once received, highlighting the lack of comprehensive care for people suffering from Long COVID.</p><p>Clinics shut down, gone silent or even scaled back. Patients didn’t dissapear, care did. Its not progress is abandonment.</p></div></section></body></html>
